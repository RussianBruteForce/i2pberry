I2Pberry

VJ2.1.1 https://github.com/m6urns/i2pberry/blob/master/torrents/i2pberry_VJ2.1.1.zip.torrent?raw=true

VJ2.1.1_live

2.1.1 is the latest release. It comes in two versions, 
VJ2.1.1 the standard user configured version and VJ2.1.1_live 
i2p is already installed, configured and on first boot will 
connect to the i2p darknet.

I've been watching the development of i2pd and I'm waiting 
for their release of an offical ARM port. Once that happens
VC1.0 will be relased, hopefully performance will
be greatly improved.

All versions will be distributed via torrent, found in the 
torrents directory.
